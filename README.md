This is an app that suggests a hero to play in marvel rivals based off of your team comp and/or the enemy team comp. jsherohelper1.js does the random character select and does the hero suggestion generation. jsheros is a json list of all the heros and their class, type, teamups and win percentage. Jsherodropdown is the code to generate each of the dropdowns for the character selects. jsherofavs stores the favorites and least favorites in local storage so it doesn't need to be updated each use by the user.
